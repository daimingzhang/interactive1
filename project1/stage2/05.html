  <h1>The New Typography[<em>1923</em>&nbsp;]&mdash;Laszlo Moholy-Nagy</h1>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h2>Typography is a tool of communication. It must be communication in its most intense form. </h2>
  <br>
  <h3>The emphasis must be on absolute clarity since this distinguishes the character of our own writing from that of ancient pictographic forms.</h3> 
  <br>
  <h4>Our intellectual relationship to the world is individual-exact (e.g.,this individual-exact relationship is in a state of transition toward a collective-exact orientation).</h4>
  <br>
  <h5>This is in contrast to the ancient individual-amorphous and later collective- amorphous mode of communication. Therefore priority: unequivocal clarity in all typographical compositions.</h5>
  <br>
  <h6> Legibility-communication must never be impaired by an a priori aesthetics. </h6>
