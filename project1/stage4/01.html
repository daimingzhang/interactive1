  <div class="box first"><strong>The New Typography [1923]&mdash;Laszlo Moholy-Nagy</strong>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

Typography is a tool of communication. It must be communication in its most intense form. 
<br>
The emphasis must be on absolute clarity since this distinguishes the character of our own writing from that of ancient pictographic forms. 
<br>
Our intellectual relationship to the world is individual-exact (e.g.,this individual-exact relationship is in a state of transition toward a collective-exact orientation). 
<br>
This is in contrast to the ancient individual-amorphous and later collective- amorphous mode of communication. 
<br>
Therefore priority: unequivocal clarity in all typographical compositions. Legibility-communication must never be impaired by an a priori aesthetics.
